# Inferring Species Trees

This repository contains tutorials for learning about inference of species trees from gene trees that vary according to some process (such as coalescent sorting, horizontal transfer, or gene duplication and loss). We will use [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) to do inference under the full multispecies coalescent model. We will also use ASTRAL to perform fast species tree analyses that are scalable to large datasets, but also come with some tradeoffs. You will need [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) and [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL#installation) available on your machine, along with [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) or another tree viewer.

Now we'll carry out fast species tree analyses with ASTRAL. We can start by re-analyzing the same data that we just analyzed in RevBayes. To do so, download [this](https://github.com/IntroPhylogenomics/SpeciesTreeInference/blob/master/unrooted_trees.tre) file which simply contains unrooted estimates of gene trees for the loci that we just analyzed in RevBayes. You can run a quick ASTRAL analysis of these gene trees with:

```
java -jar astral.5.6.3.jar -i /path/to/unrooted_trees.tre -o species.tre
```
Open this estimate of the species tree with FigTree and compare it to your estimate from RevBayes. Are the trees similar? What is likely driving any differences?

ASTRAL contains much more functionality and easily scales to thousands of gene trees. The following tutorial will explain much of this extra functionality and provide examples of very large scale analyses.
